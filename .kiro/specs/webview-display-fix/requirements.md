# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature fixes the webview display issue where the VS Code extension shows "Drawing Canvas opened successfully!" but the actual drawing canvas interface is not visible to the user. The problem is that the webview is not properly displaying in the VS Code interface, likely due to incorrect webview view registration or focus handling.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Webview Panel Display Fix

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the drawing canvas to actually appear in the VS Code interface when I run "VSS: Open Drawing Canvas", so that I can see and interact with the drawing tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user runs "VSS: Open Drawing Canvas" THEN the webview SHALL display visibly in the VS Code interface
2. WHEN the webview opens THEN it SHALL show the HTML canvas element with drawing tools and status bar
3. WHEN the webview is displayed THEN users SHALL be able to interact with the canvas (draw, use tools, clear canvas)
4. WHEN the webview fails to load THEN it SHALL display a clear error message with troubleshooting steps
5. WHEN the webview is opened multiple times THEN it SHALL focus the existing webview instead of creating duplicates

### Requirement 2: Webview View Provider Registration Fix

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the webview to be properly registered in VS Code's view system, so that it appears in the correct location and behaves like other VS Code panels.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the extension activates THEN it SHALL register the webview view provider with the correct view ID
2. WHEN the webview is registered THEN it SHALL appear in the Explorer sidebar or as a dedicated panel
3. WHEN the webview view is resolved THEN it SHALL load the HTML content successfully
4. WHEN the webview is focused THEN it SHALL bring the panel to the foreground and make it visible
5. WHEN VS Code restarts THEN the webview SHALL retain its state if it was previously open

### Requirement 3: Command Execution and Focus Handling

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the "VSS: Open Drawing Canvas" command to properly open and focus the webview, so that I can immediately start using the drawing tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the command executes THEN it SHALL open the webview panel if not already open
2. WHEN the command executes THEN it SHALL focus the webview panel to make it visible
3. WHEN the webview is already open THEN the command SHALL focus the existing panel
4. WHEN the command fails THEN it SHALL provide specific error information about what went wrong
5. WHEN the webview opens THEN it SHALL send a ready message to confirm successful initialization

### Requirement 4: Webview Content Loading and Error Handling

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear feedback when the webview content fails to load, so that I can troubleshoot and fix any issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the webview HTML loads successfully THEN it SHALL display the canvas interface with tools
2. WHEN the webview HTML fails to load THEN it SHALL display an error page with diagnostic information
3. WHEN JavaScript errors occur in the webview THEN they SHALL be logged and reported to the extension
4. WHEN the webview loses connection THEN it SHALL show a disconnected status and attempt to reconnect
5. WHEN the webview is ready THEN it SHALL send a confirmation message to the extension host

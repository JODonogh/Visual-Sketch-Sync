# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature fixes a JavaScript runtime error in the Visual Sketch Sync webview where the identifier 'hasInitialized' is being declared multiple times, causing a SyntaxError. The error occurs during webview initialization and prevents the canvas from loading properly. This issue is likely caused by the webview script being executed multiple times without proper cleanup or variable scoping.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Fix Duplicate Variable Declaration Error

**User Story:** As a user, I want the webview to initialize without JavaScript errors, so that I can use the drawing canvas functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the webview loads THEN it SHALL not throw "Identifier 'hasInitialized' has already been declared" errors
2. WHEN the webview script executes multiple times THEN it SHALL handle variable redeclaration gracefully
3. WHEN the webview is reloaded or refreshed THEN it SHALL initialize cleanly without variable conflicts
4. WHEN multiple webview instances exist THEN they SHALL not interfere with each other's variable declarations
5. WHEN the initialization process runs THEN it SHALL complete successfully without SyntaxError exceptions

### Requirement 2: Implement Proper Variable Scoping and Cleanup

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the webview JavaScript to use proper scoping patterns, so that variables don't conflict during reinitialization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN variables are declared in the webview THEN they SHALL be properly scoped to avoid global conflicts
2. WHEN the webview is disposed or reloaded THEN it SHALL clean up existing variables and event listeners
3. WHEN using let/const declarations THEN they SHALL be wrapped in appropriate scopes to prevent redeclaration
4. WHEN the webview reinitializes THEN it SHALL check for existing variables before declaration
5. WHEN multiple script executions occur THEN they SHALL not create naming conflicts

### Requirement 3: Ensure Robust Webview Lifecycle Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want the webview to handle initialization, reloading, and disposal gracefully, so that I have a reliable drawing experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the webview initializes for the first time THEN it SHALL set up all necessary variables and event handlers
2. WHEN the webview is reloaded THEN it SHALL properly reset its state without errors
3. WHEN the webview is disposed THEN it SHALL clean up resources and remove event listeners
4. WHEN initialization fails THEN it SHALL provide clear error messages and recovery options
5. WHEN the webview recovers from errors THEN it SHALL restore full functionality

### Requirement 4: Maintain Canvas Functionality and Performance

**User Story:** As a user, I want all existing canvas features to continue working after the initialization fix, so that no functionality is lost.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the initialization fix is applied THEN all drawing tools SHALL continue to work as expected
2. WHEN the canvas loads THEN it SHALL display the toolbar, status bar, and drawing area correctly
3. WHEN drawing operations are performed THEN they SHALL function without performance degradation
4. WHEN error handling is active THEN it SHALL not interfere with normal canvas operations
5. WHEN the webview communicates with VS Code THEN message passing SHALL work reliably

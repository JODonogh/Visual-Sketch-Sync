# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the VSS Drawing Canvas with improved drawing tools, better UI design, and robust code generation functionality. The enhancements focus on providing professional drawing capabilities with proper tool persistence, advanced shape options, and reliable code export features.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Compact Toolbar Design

**User Story:** As a user, I want a smaller, less intrusive toolbar so that I have more canvas space for drawing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the webview loads THEN the toolbar SHALL be reduced in height by at least 30%
2. WHEN the toolbar is displayed THEN it SHALL use compact button sizing with minimal padding
3. WHEN multiple tools are shown THEN they SHALL be arranged efficiently to minimize vertical space
4. WHEN the toolbar is positioned THEN it SHALL not obstruct the main drawing area

### Requirement 2: Streamlined Tool Selection

**User Story:** As a user, I want a focused set of drawing tools without unnecessary options so that I can work more efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the toolbar loads THEN the brush tool SHALL be removed from the interface
2. WHEN tools are displayed THEN only pen, rectangle, circle, line, eraser, clear, generate code, and settings SHALL be available
3. WHEN a tool is selected THEN it SHALL remain active until another tool is explicitly chosen
4. WHEN switching between tools THEN the previous tool's state SHALL be properly cleaned up

### Requirement 3: Advanced Shape Drawing Options

**User Story:** As a user, I want shapes with fill/outline options and advanced properties so that I can create more sophisticated drawings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN drawing a rectangle THEN I SHALL be able to choose between outline-only or filled rendering
2. WHEN drawing a rectangle THEN I SHALL be able to set rounded corner radius from 0 to 50 pixels
3. WHEN drawing a circle THEN I SHALL be able to choose between outline-only or filled rendering
4. WHEN drawing a circle THEN I SHALL be able to create ellipses by dragging to different width/height ratios
5. WHEN drawing a line THEN I SHALL be able to choose between outline-only or filled rendering (for thick lines)
6. WHEN shape options are changed THEN they SHALL persist until explicitly modified again

### Requirement 4: Persistent Drawing State

**User Story:** As a user, I want my drawings to persist when switching between tools so that I don't lose my work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I draw a rectangle and switch to circle tool THEN the rectangle SHALL remain visible on the canvas
2. WHEN I draw multiple shapes with different tools THEN all shapes SHALL remain visible simultaneously
3. WHEN I switch between any tools THEN previously drawn elements SHALL not disappear
4. WHEN the canvas is cleared THEN all drawn elements SHALL be removed at once

### Requirement 5: Reliable Eraser Functionality

**User Story:** As a user, I want the eraser to work properly without breaking other tools so that I can make corrections easily.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I use the eraser tool THEN it SHALL remove parts of the drawing without affecting tool switching
2. WHEN I switch from eraser to any other tool THEN the new tool SHALL work correctly
3. WHEN using the eraser THEN the canvas composite operation SHALL be properly reset when switching tools
4. WHEN eraser is active THEN it SHALL provide visual feedback showing the eraser size and position

### Requirement 6: Working Pressure Sensitivity

**User Story:** As a user with a pressure-sensitive stylus, I want pressure sensitivity to work correctly so that I can create natural-looking strokes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I use a pressure-sensitive stylus THEN stroke width SHALL vary based on pressure input
2. WHEN pressure sensitivity is enabled THEN light pressure SHALL create thin strokes and heavy pressure SHALL create thick strokes
3. WHEN using a mouse THEN pressure sensitivity SHALL be simulated based on drawing speed or disabled gracefully
4. WHEN pressure sensitivity settings are changed THEN they SHALL take effect immediately for new strokes

### Requirement 7: Robust Code Generation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want reliable code generation that exports my drawings in multiple formats so that I can use them in my projects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click generate code THEN it SHALL produce valid HTML, SVG, CSS, and JavaScript code
2. WHEN code is generated THEN it SHALL accurately represent all drawn elements with correct properties
3. WHEN code generation encounters errors THEN it SHALL provide clear error messages and recovery options
4. WHEN generated code is copied THEN it SHALL be immediately usable in external projects
5. WHEN autoformatting occurs THEN the code generation functions SHALL remain functional and not corrupt

### Requirement 8: Enhanced Settings Panel

**User Story:** As a user, I want comprehensive drawing settings that control all aspects of my tools so that I can customize my drawing experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I open settings THEN I SHALL see options for fill/outline mode for shapes
2. WHEN I open settings THEN I SHALL see corner radius controls for rectangles
3. WHEN I open settings THEN I SHALL see aspect ratio controls for ellipses
4. WHEN I change settings THEN they SHALL apply to newly drawn elements immediately
5. WHEN settings are modified THEN they SHALL persist across tool switches

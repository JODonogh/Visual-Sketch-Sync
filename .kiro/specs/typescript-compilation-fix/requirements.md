# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature fixes TypeScript compilation errors that are preventing the VS Code extension from building and packaging successfully. The errors are occurring in test files and include issues with Mocha imports, error type handling, and undefined property access. These compilation errors must be resolved to allow the extension to be packaged with `vsce package`.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Fix Mocha Import and Constructor Issues

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the test files to properly import and use Mocha, so that the TypeScript compiler doesn't throw constructor errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN TypeScript compiles the test files THEN it SHALL not throw "This expression is not constructable" errors for Mocha
2. WHEN importing Mocha in test files THEN it SHALL use the correct import syntax that supports constructor calls
3. WHEN creating new Mocha instances THEN the TypeScript compiler SHALL recognize the constructor as valid
4. WHEN the mocha.run callback is defined THEN it SHALL have proper type annotations for the failures parameter
5. WHEN test files are compiled THEN they SHALL produce valid JavaScript without type errors

### Requirement 2: Fix Error Type Handling

**User Story:** As a developer, I want error objects to be properly typed in catch blocks, so that TypeScript doesn't complain about accessing error properties.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN catching errors in try-catch blocks THEN the error SHALL be properly typed or type-guarded
2. WHEN accessing error.message property THEN TypeScript SHALL not throw "error is of type unknown" errors
3. WHEN logging error information THEN the code SHALL safely access error properties with proper type checking
4. WHEN error handling code is compiled THEN it SHALL not produce type safety warnings
5. WHEN errors are caught THEN they SHALL be handled with appropriate type assertions or guards

### Requirement 3: Fix Undefined Property Access Issues

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to safely access object properties that might be undefined, so that TypeScript doesn't throw "possibly undefined" errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing panelStats.uptime property THEN it SHALL be checked for undefined before use
2. WHEN object properties might be undefined THEN the code SHALL use optional chaining or null checks
3. WHEN TypeScript strict null checks are enabled THEN all property access SHALL be null-safe
4. WHEN accessing potentially undefined properties THEN appropriate default values or guards SHALL be used
5. WHEN the code is compiled THEN it SHALL not produce "possibly undefined" warnings

### Requirement 4: Ensure Clean Compilation and Packaging

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the extension to compile without any TypeScript errors, so that I can successfully package it with vsce.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running `npm run compile` THEN it SHALL complete without any TypeScript errors
2. WHEN running `vsce package` THEN it SHALL successfully create the .vsix file without compilation failures
3. WHEN the prepublish script runs THEN it SHALL pass the TypeScript compilation step
4. WHEN all TypeScript files are processed THEN they SHALL produce valid JavaScript output
5. WHEN the extension is packaged THEN it SHALL include all compiled files without errors

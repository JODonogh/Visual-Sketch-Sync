# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the current Content Security Policy (CSP) violations and canvas initialization errors in the Visual Sketch Sync Drawing Canvas. Despite previous fixes, the webview is still experiencing numerous CSP violations that prevent stylesheets and scripts from loading, causing the canvas to display error messages and fail to initialize properly. The solution needs to implement a comprehensive CSP-compliant approach that ensures all resources load correctly within VS Code's security constraints.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Eliminate Content Security Policy Violations

**User Story:** As a user, I want all canvas resources to load without security violations so that the drawing interface displays correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the webview loads THEN no "Refused to apply inline style" CSP violations SHALL occur
2. WHEN stylesheets are loaded THEN they SHALL use proper vscode-resource URIs or be inlined safely
3. WHEN the CSP meta tag is parsed THEN it SHALL use correct syntax with proper directive separators
4. WHEN external resources are referenced THEN they SHALL comply with VS Code's webview security model
5. WHEN the canvas initializes THEN all visual elements SHALL render without CSP blocking

### Requirement 2: Fix Canvas Initialization and Error Recovery

**User Story:** As a user, I want the canvas to initialize successfully without showing error screens so that I can start drawing immediately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the webview opens THEN it SHALL display the drawing canvas instead of error messages
2. WHEN initialization fails THEN recovery mechanisms SHALL attempt to restore functionality automatically
3. WHEN the "Canvas Error" appears THEN retry functionality SHALL successfully reload the canvas
4. WHEN scripts fail to load THEN fallback initialization SHALL provide basic drawing functionality
5. WHEN the canvas is ready THEN the status SHALL show "Connected" instead of "Disconnected"

### Requirement 3: Implement Robust Resource Loading Strategy

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a reliable resource loading system that works within CSP constraints so that the extension functions consistently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN CSS resources are needed THEN they SHALL be loaded using CSP-compliant methods
2. WHEN external stylesheets fail THEN inline CSS fallbacks SHALL provide essential styling
3. WHEN script resources are loaded THEN they SHALL use proper vscode-resource URIs
4. WHEN resource loading fails THEN diagnostic information SHALL be logged for troubleshooting
5. WHEN the webview reloads THEN resource loading SHALL be consistent and reliable

### Requirement 4: Ensure Drawing Tools Functionality

**User Story:** As a user, I want all drawing tools to work correctly after the CSP fixes so that I can create drawings without limitations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the canvas loads THEN all drawing tools (pen, rectangle, circle, line, eraser) SHALL be functional
2. WHEN I select a tool THEN it SHALL activate properly with correct cursor and behavior
3. WHEN I draw on the canvas THEN strokes and shapes SHALL appear correctly
4. WHEN I use the settings panel THEN all controls SHALL work and apply changes immediately
5. WHEN I generate code THEN it SHALL produce valid output representing my drawings

### Requirement 5: Maintain Extension Communication

**User Story:** As a user, I want the webview to communicate properly with VS Code so that extension features work seamlessly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the webview initializes THEN it SHALL establish communication with the VS Code extension
2. WHEN drawing actions occur THEN they SHALL be properly communicated to the extension if needed
3. WHEN the connection status is displayed THEN it SHALL accurately reflect the communication state
4. WHEN extension commands are triggered THEN the webview SHALL respond appropriately
5. WHEN the webview is disposed THEN cleanup SHALL occur without leaving orphaned processes

### Requirement 6: Provide Clear Error Reporting and Recovery

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear error messages and recovery options so that I can quickly resolve any remaining issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN CSP violations occur THEN they SHALL be logged with specific resource information
2. WHEN initialization fails THEN error messages SHALL provide actionable troubleshooting steps
3. WHEN recovery mechanisms activate THEN users SHALL be notified of the recovery attempt
4. WHEN errors are resolved THEN success confirmation SHALL be displayed to the user
5. WHEN diagnostic information is needed THEN it SHALL be easily accessible through the interface

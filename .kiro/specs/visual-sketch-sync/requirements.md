# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature creates a visual sketch-to-code synchronization system that allows developers to build React applications with real-time bidirectional sync between a visual canvas and VS Code. The system uses a WebSocket-based architecture with AST manipulation to enable seamless design changes that automatically update source code, and code changes that instantly reflect in the visual interface.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: VS Code Extension Command Registration and Activation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the VS Code extension commands to be properly registered and functional, so that I can access the drawing canvas and other VSS features through the command palette.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the extension activates THEN it SHALL register all commands declared in package.json including vss.openDrawingCanvas
2. WHEN a user runs "VSS: Open Drawing Canvas" THEN the command SHALL execute without errors and open the drawing canvas webview
3. WHEN the extension loads THEN it SHALL properly initialize the webview provider and command handlers
4. WHEN commands are executed THEN they SHALL provide appropriate user feedback and error handling
5. WHEN installing the extension THEN it SHALL provide clear installation instructions that avoid cyclic copy errors
6. WHEN the extension is packaged THEN it SHALL create a proper .vsix file for installation

### Requirement 2: Extension Installation and Development Setup

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear and working installation methods for the VS Code extension, so that I can properly install and test the extension without errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using F5 development mode THEN the extension SHALL load properly in the Extension Development Host window
2. WHEN packaging the extension THEN it SHALL create a valid .vsix file using vsce package command
3. WHEN installing from .vsix THEN the extension SHALL install correctly without cyclic copy errors
4. WHEN the extension is installed THEN all declared commands SHALL be available in the command palette
5. WHEN running the extension THEN it SHALL handle SQLite experimental warnings gracefully without affecting functionality

### Requirement 3: Design-to-Code Synchronization Server

**User Story:** As a designer, I want my visual changes to automatically update the source code files, so that design modifications are immediately persisted and reflected in the codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN receiving design events THEN the sync server SHALL listen for WebSocket events including MOVE_COMPONENT, UPDATE_PROP, and ADD_COMPONENT
2. WHEN monitoring file changes THEN the server SHALL use chokidar to watch DesignData.json and notify clients of changes
3. WHEN updating design files THEN the server SHALL use @babel/parser and recast to modify DesignData.json while preserving formatting
4. WHEN processing design events THEN the updateDesignFile function SHALL parse the JSON, apply changes based on event type, and rewrite the file

### Requirement 4: Component Registration and Schema Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to define which component properties are visually editable, so that designers can modify only the appropriate aspects of my components through the visual interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN registering a component THEN the schema SHALL define all visually editable props with their input types (text, color, boolean, etc.)
2. WHEN defining component schemas THEN the registration system SHALL serve as the source of truth for the visual canvas
3. WHEN components are registered THEN they SHALL be available for use in the visual design interface
4. WHEN schema changes occur THEN the visual interface SHALL update to reflect new editable properties

### Requirement 5: Real-time Synchronization and State Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want instant synchronization between code and design changes, so that I can see the results of my modifications immediately without manual refresh.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code changes occur THEN the visual interface SHALL update instantly through WebSocket communication
2. WHEN design changes are made THEN the source files SHALL be updated immediately using AST manipulation
3. WHEN the sync server is running THEN it SHALL maintain persistent WebSocket connections with all active clients
4. WHEN file system changes occur THEN the file watcher SHALL trigger appropriate notifications to connected clients

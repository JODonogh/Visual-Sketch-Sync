# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature creates a visual sketch-to-code synchronization system that allows developers to build React applications with real-time bidirectional sync between a visual canvas and VS Code. The system uses a WebSocket-based architecture with AST manipulation to enable seamless design changes that automatically update source code, and code changes that instantly reflect in the visual interface.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Project Setup and Dependencies Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Kiro to automatically configure my project with the necessary dependencies and scripts, so that I can start using the visual design sync without manual setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN initializing the project THEN Kiro SHALL modify package.json to add a "dev:sync" script that runs "node ./scripts/vss-sync-server.js"
2. WHEN setting up the project THEN Kiro SHALL modify the start script to "concurrently \"npm run dev:ui\" \"npm run dev:sync\"" to run both UI and sync servers
3. WHEN configuring dependencies THEN Kiro SHALL install concurrently, ws, chokidar, recast, and @babel/parser packages
4. WHEN creating the project structure THEN Kiro SHALL generate a scripts/ directory containing vss-sync-server.js

### Requirement 2: Code-Design Runtime Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a React runtime system that connects my components to the visual design system, so that I can build components that are automatically synchronized with the visual canvas.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating the runtime THEN Kiro SHALL generate a VSSProvider component that establishes WebSocket connection to the sync server
2. WHEN managing design data THEN the VSSProvider SHALL fetch and manage Design Data from DesignData.json file
3. WHEN accessing component data THEN Kiro SHALL provide a useVSSData() hook that allows components to fetch props based on their vss-id
4. WHEN registering components THEN Kiro SHALL generate a registerComponent utility that accepts a component and schema defining visually editable props
5. WHEN initializing design data THEN Kiro SHALL create an initial DesignData.json file with basic page structure

### Requirement 3: Design-to-Code Synchronization Server

**User Story:** As a designer, I want my visual changes to automatically update the source code files, so that design modifications are immediately persisted and reflected in the codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN receiving design events THEN the sync server SHALL listen for WebSocket events including MOVE_COMPONENT, UPDATE_PROP, and ADD_COMPONENT
2. WHEN monitoring file changes THEN the server SHALL use chokidar to watch DesignData.json and notify clients of changes
3. WHEN updating design files THEN the server SHALL use @babel/parser and recast to modify DesignData.json while preserving formatting
4. WHEN processing design events THEN the updateDesignFile function SHALL parse the JSON, apply changes based on event type, and rewrite the file

### Requirement 4: Component Registration and Schema Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to define which component properties are visually editable, so that designers can modify only the appropriate aspects of my components through the visual interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN registering a component THEN the schema SHALL define all visually editable props with their input types (text, color, boolean, etc.)
2. WHEN defining component schemas THEN the registration system SHALL serve as the source of truth for the visual canvas
3. WHEN components are registered THEN they SHALL be available for use in the visual design interface
4. WHEN schema changes occur THEN the visual interface SHALL update to reflect new editable properties

### Requirement 5: Real-time Synchronization and State Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want instant synchronization between code and design changes, so that I can see the results of my modifications immediately without manual refresh.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code changes occur THEN the visual interface SHALL update instantly through WebSocket communication
2. WHEN design changes are made THEN the source files SHALL be updated immediately using AST manipulation
3. WHEN the sync server is running THEN it SHALL maintain persistent WebSocket connections with all active clients
4. WHEN file system changes occur THEN the file watcher SHALL trigger appropriate notifications to connected clients

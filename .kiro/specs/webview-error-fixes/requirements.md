# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical webview errors in the VSS Drawing Canvas extension that are preventing proper functionality. The errors include VS Code API conflicts, Content Security Policy violations, and meta element parsing issues that need to be resolved for the extension to work correctly.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: VS Code API Conflict Resolution

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the webview to properly initialize without VS Code API conflicts so that the extension loads correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the webview loads THEN the VS Code API SHALL be acquired only once
2. WHEN multiple scripts try to access the API THEN proper API sharing SHALL be implemented
3. WHEN the webview initializes THEN no "VS Code API already acquired" errors SHALL occur
4. WHEN API access is needed THEN a centralized API manager SHALL provide access

### Requirement 2: Content Security Policy Compliance

**User Story:** As a user, I want all stylesheets to load properly so that the webview displays correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the webview loads THEN all CSS files SHALL be loaded without CSP violations
2. WHEN external stylesheets are referenced THEN they SHALL use proper vscode-resource URIs
3. WHEN CSP directives are defined THEN they SHALL allow necessary resources
4. WHEN styles are applied THEN they SHALL not be blocked by security policies

### Requirement 3: Meta Element Parsing Fix

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper meta element syntax so that the webview parses correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN meta elements are parsed THEN they SHALL use valid key-value pair separators
2. WHEN CSP meta tags are defined THEN they SHALL use comma separators instead of semicolons
3. WHEN the HTML is validated THEN no meta element parsing errors SHALL occur
4. WHEN the webview loads THEN all meta elements SHALL be properly formatted

### Requirement 4: Script Loading Order Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want scripts to load in the correct order so that dependencies are available when needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scripts are loaded THEN the VS Code API SHALL be available before other scripts execute
2. WHEN multiple scripts depend on shared resources THEN loading order SHALL be enforced
3. WHEN script initialization occurs THEN proper dependency management SHALL be implemented
4. WHEN errors occur during loading THEN graceful fallback mechanisms SHALL be provided

### Requirement 5: Resource URI Security Compliance

**User Story:** As a user, I want all resources to load securely so that the extension works within VS Code's security model.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN resources are referenced THEN they SHALL use proper vscode-resource scheme URIs
2. WHEN external files are loaded THEN they SHALL comply with webview security restrictions
3. WHEN resource paths are constructed THEN they SHALL be properly encoded and validated
4. WHEN security policies are enforced THEN all resources SHALL load successfully

### Requirement 6: Error Recovery and Diagnostics

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear error reporting and recovery mechanisms so that I can diagnose and fix issues quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN webview errors occur THEN they SHALL be logged with detailed context information
2. WHEN initialization fails THEN recovery mechanisms SHALL attempt to restore functionality
3. WHEN CSP violations occur THEN alternative loading strategies SHALL be attempted
4. WHEN API conflicts arise THEN error messages SHALL provide actionable guidance
